---

Welcome to the Virtual Escape Room Project ‚Äì Level 3, where we enhance our immersive puzzle-solving experience using MongoDB as the data persistence layer.

## üìå Project Overview
This application simulates a Virtual Escape Room, where users can enjoy themed rooms, follow clues, and interact with unique decorative items. Level 3 builds upon previous levels but replaces MySQL with MongoDB for data management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Java 17+
MongoDB
MongoDB Java Driver
Lombok
JUnit (for testing)
Mockit

## üß± Core Entities
Escape Room: The main entity containing rooms, clues, and decorations.
Room: Each with a name, difficulty, and collections of clues and decorations.
Clue: Includes a name, price, and theme (e.g., PUZZLE, PASSWORD).
Decoration: Has a name, price, and material type (e.g., WOOD, METAL).
Ticket: Represents a user's entry with a recorded value.
Certificate: Issued to users who complete the rooms successfully.
Player : has an name, an email and isSubscribed (or needs to unsubscribe) and has ticketsBought list.

## üß™ Testing (from Level 2) 
(at least two core functionalities are tested using JUnit)
- Creating a room (RoomTest)
- Sending Newsletter to all players in database, sending Newletter to susbcribed players, according to Oberver Pattern (NotificationServiceTest).
- Inserting a new room into MongoDB database and notifying all subscribed players (RoomDAOImplTest)

üíæ MongoDB Integration (Level 3)
‚úÖ Collections:
- escape_rooms: Stores all data about rooms, clues, and decorations. Each room document embeds sub-documents for clues and decorations
- players : stores all about players tickets

‚úÖ Singleton Pattern
‚úÖ Observer Pattern
‚úÖ DAO Pattern: The app uses the DAO pattern to separate data access logic. Interfaces are defined for each domain (e.g., ClueDAO, RoomDAO), and implementations like ClueDAOImpl use the MongoDB Java driver.



‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started
Install MongoDB and ensure it's running on localhost:27017.

Clone the project:
git clone https://github.com/Jusep1983/S303_Developers_team
cd escape-room-mongodb
Run the application (Main class).

Interact via console-based menu.

üì¨ Notifications : 
- A new room is created
- Newsletter to susbcribed player and to all players.

üìà Future Improvements
GUI interface with JavaFX or Spring Boot REST API
User authentication and tracking
Multiplayer collaboration features
